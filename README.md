During the time of my student exchange year I used this app to write down my thoughts every day.

The concept is simple, you click the "New" button, type in whatever happened that day, add a feeling and press save. Just like that I was able to capture a whole year in one text file.

Now to some more technical stuff. When I first developed this app I was pretty inexperienced and didn't know how to do most of the things necessary to do this properly. Fast forward a couple years and now I finally got to finish it. The biggest flaw is still the way the entries are stored, but I won't change that, not for now at least.

So what other things can you do with this application? Well, you can view all the past entries. It is also possible to search for specific dates or specific text within all the entries.

## TODO

- add keyboard shortcuts
    - ctrl+enter to save
- import
    - match entries by uuid
    - scan for differences
